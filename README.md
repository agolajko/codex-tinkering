# Codex Tinkering NAICS Lookup

This repository provides a simple full-stack example for looking up NAICS codes.
It contains a React frontend using Fuse.js and an AWS Lambda backend that
leverages OpenAI.

* `data/naics.json` – sample NAICS codes
* `frontend/` – React application
* `backend/` – Lambda function

Both pieces are meant to be deployed with AWS Amplify.
